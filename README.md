### Description

KitchenSync+ is an online application that can be used to organize groups and shopping lists. Users will register via Google Oauth and be able to create groups called “Communities” that users will be able to search recipes and create shopping lists based on what is required. Individual members of the community will have the ability to self assign needed ingredients that they will purchase for the recipe. Our goal is to make your Kitchen in sync!
